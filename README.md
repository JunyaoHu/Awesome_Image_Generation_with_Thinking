Welcome to the Awesome-Image-Generation-with-Thinking repository! This repository represents a comprehensive collection of research focused on empowering models to think during image generation. We delve into how these sophisticated models are evolving beyond mere pattern recognition, acquiring capabilities for intricate reasoning, nuanced understanding, and dynamic interaction by processing and interpreting visual information in cognitive-inspired ways.

This collection is for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts eager to explore the forefront of:
*   **Prompt-Based Innovation:** How LVLMs can guide visual understanding and generation.
*   **Supervised Fine-Tuning:** Training models with rich, contextual visual data.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Enabling agents to learn through visual interaction and feedback.

## 🚀 Editing-based explicitly reflection

Unlocking visual intelligence through the art and science of prompting. These methods explore how carefully crafted textual or visual cues can guide LVLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks with images, often without explicit task-specific training.

## 🎓 Reasoning with prompt

Tailoring pre-trained models for visual reasoning through targeted fine-tuning on specialized datasets. This approach leverages instruction-following data and demonstrations of reasoning steps to enhance model capabilities.

## 🏆 RL for Self-Evolution

Harnessing the power of Reinforcement Learning to teach models how to reason with images through trial, error, and reward. These approaches enable agents to learn complex visual behaviors, tool interactions, and even intrinsic motivation for exploration.
